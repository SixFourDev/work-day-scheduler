# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

My motivation on building this webpage was to use the skills we learned this week in class, and create a work day scheduler using Javascript. The reason building this webpage was to allow users visit, and have them write and input their busy schedule. A few things I've learned creating this webpage was using jQuery elements (siblings, closest, each, parseInt, toggleClass), had to go back and review using "this", using localStorage to save user inputs, and using dayjs to get the current date and time!

## Usage

This webpage was created to help users organize their busy schedule by allowing them to input their 9-5 work day. When you get presented the webpage, you can see at the top of the page that there is the current day, date, and time updated in real-time. Each time-block is color coordinated with the past being gray, present being red, and future being green. To input your schedule, simply type in the textbox of any given time (from 9am-5pm) with your schedule, then click the blue box of that time-block to save it to your schedule. If you refresh the page it will show what has been saved by using the local storage.
